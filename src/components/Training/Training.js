              Music is an art form whose medium is sound and silence. Generally,
              a song is considered the smallest standalone work of music,
              especially when involving singing.

              The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and
              harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and
              articulation), dynamics, and the sonic qualities of timbre and
              texture.
